# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The application.py file contains every function that is used for the website. env.sh, is a shell file that contains all of the environmental variables, it was used purely for the purpose of simplifying the process of running flask.
In the templates directory, you will find every page used for the website, unforunately I was unable to successfully fullfil the check in requirement for this project, I could not solve the problem. I also failed to make comments unique due to the fact that I had difficulties setting up the checkins SQL table properly. As a result of the checkins table not behaving properly, "check-ins" is also missing from api/zip route.
import.py is a program that imports all of the information from zips.csv to the SQL table zips.
